# Chef Desktop Quick Setup

Code repository to set up a demo infrastructure for Chef Desktop in under 15 mins. 

## Motivation

The current documentation is quite complex at times for users new to chef ecosystem who want to try Chef Desktop themselves. This repository aims at overcoming the barriers of configuring a demonstration setup that allows users and IT admins to quickly launch the components and get introduced to some of the core concepts.

## Content

By utilizing [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and leveraging module blocks to organise and provide a flexible set up strategy; we have four common modules for each provider that orchestrate the entire process, namely,
- automate
- nodes
- gorilla
- munki

## Getting started
